# üîî inotifywait (with polling)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/javanile/inotifywait-polling.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/javanile/inotifywait-polling)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/javanile/inotifywait-polling/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/javanile/inotifywait-polling)

Today **inotify** has limitaions on watch for chagnes into particular filesystem or mount point. Here is a short list

- Mountend volumes from Docker containers in a Microsoft Windows host.
- Mountend directories with file system SMB/NFS from GNU/Linux host.

In all of this cases you can use **inotifywait-polling** instead of classic **inotifywait** to watch for changes into the above scenarious.

## Install

The most common way to install the project is from GitHub source

```shell
git clone https://github.com/javanile/inotifywait-polling.git
sudo cp ./inotifywait-polling/inotifywait-polling.sh /usr/local/bin/inotifywait-polling
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/inotifywait-polling
```

## Usage

It works exactly like the original, so it accepts the same options, with the only difference that it checks every 5 seconds that your target has changed or not (unfortunately this is the only way around the problem in those file systems where the original does not work).

```shell
$ inotifywait-polling $HOME
Setting up watches.
Watches established.
```

### Dockerfile

```bash
RUN curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/javanile/inotifywait-polling/main/setup.sh | bin=inotifywait bash -
```
